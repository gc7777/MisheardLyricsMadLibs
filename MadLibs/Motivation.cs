Pay attention, because I'm going to tell you stuff not even (talk show host) will tell you about finance. I'm coming to you from my garage, just took my (car brand) out for a spin. I know what you're thinking. You see me standing in front of my (number) (car brand) and you want to know, (same washed up celeb) what's your secret? Pay attention and I'll teach you everything. About six years ago, I was working at (place) and my mentor (another person) came in wearing (clothing brand) shoes and I just knew I had to be like him. I took him out for (cheap beverage) and he told me, (washed up celeb person), you need to dropship (plural noun). At that time I had no idea what dropshipping was, but what he told me was so simple. All you have to do is just buy (number) (plural noun) from (country) and sell them at a (percentage) markup on (website). That's it! That is all I do. Then I just cash my cheque for $(amount) and then I can spend it on whatever I want. If I want to vacation in (city) no one's gonna stop me. I've got the freedom to buy (plural noun) every day if I want to. I'll tell you what, (percentage) of people won't even try this. They'll be stuck (verb ending -ing) all day at a (noun) they hate and I'll be laughing, drinking my (beverage) by the (noun). And you can too if you buy my ebook, 'How to (verb) (adverb)' but only for the next (number) minutes. We can't do this all day.";

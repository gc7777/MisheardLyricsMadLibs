# Misheard Lyrics Mad Libs by Gina Carpenter
A fun twist on the classic game of Mad Libs.

## About the project
As a child, Mad Libs was one of my favourite games to play. I wanted to create a simple version of it to practice and improve my C# and maintain the nostalgia of a console app, reminiscent of the days of Commodore 64 and MS-DOS games like Hangman, Bottle Caps, and NES Dragon Warrior.
